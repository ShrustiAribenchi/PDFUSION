The Full-Stack **PDFUSION** Application I developed is a PDF chatbot that harnesses the power of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to empower users to interact with specific data within PDF documents. This comprehensive application seamlessly integrates both the backend, built with Python, and the frontend, developed using Node.js.

One of its standout features is the integration of vectordatabase technology, which allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data. Additionally, the application leverages Generative AI and LLMs, such as LangChain, a framework designed to simplify the integration of language models, to enhance the chatbot's capabilities. This combination of technologies enables the chatbot to efficiently process and understand PDF content, making it adept at analyzing and summarizing documents, answering questions.

What sets this chatbot apart is its ability to engage with prescribed data within PDFs, enabling users to ask questions, receive information, and issue commands within the defined scope of the documents. This tailored approach ensures efficient and secure interactions with the specific content of PDFs, making it a valuable tool for industries and use cases where data precision is paramount.
